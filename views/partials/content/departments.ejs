<p>In order to accomplish our lofty goals, we have divided the club into five departments: Structures, Propulsion, Avionics, Special Projects, and Outreach. Within each of these departments, our members work of small tech projects that will eventually be used on the Phase rockets. This allows them to get advanced experience in their chosen specialty while making meaningful contributions to the club.</p>
