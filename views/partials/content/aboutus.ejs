<p>Student Space Systems(SSS) is a technical organization at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign dedicated to achieving the goal of sending a completely student designed, fabricated, and built rocket to space. Along the way, we aim to fly rockets to higher and higher altitudes while making technological strides in propulsion, structures, and avionics. In addition to our technical goals, we are dedicated to educating students about rocketry and to providing opportunities to gain technical experience.</p>

<p>A core value of SSS is to enable every member, regardless of their technical background, to do meaningful work on our many projects. To help new members who might not have much technical or rocketry-related experience, we have two unique ways in which we help students gain a baseline knowledge. Starting in the Fall 2015 semester,  SSS will offer its own class dedicated to giving students an abbreviated introduction of many technical topics from basic rocket flight mechanics to general avionics design. In addition, we have a Level 1 High Power Rocketry Certification program. Participants build their own rockets to achieve a basic understanding of high power rocketry and earn a Level 1 Certification with the National Association of Rocketry (NAR).</p>
