<p>Going to space is difficult. While we wish that hard work and innovation alone could get us there, there are monetary restrictions to be considered. Every donation, of any value, can help us achieve our goals. If you are interested in being instrumental in our mission space, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:uiuc.sss@gmail.com">uiuc.sss@gmail.com.</a></p>
