<p>Recognizing that our biggest legacy will be those whom we inspire by our work, our focus on Education Outreach and STEM through activities with younger students at local schools is paramount. Outreach at SSS can be subdivided into three primary categories--Corporate Outreach, Educational Outreach, and Recruiting.</p>

<p>The Corporate Outreach subcommittee is responsible for developing relationships with companies spanning many industries for guidance and assistance in achieving our goals. (If you are a company representative or individual wishing to learn more about the sponsorship process, please see the sponsorship page). Consistent with our goals of emulating a corporate environment for Student Space Systems, leaders and senior members have outlined a process for professional correspondence with the corporate world. In addition to the obvious benefits the club as a whole receives from the invaluable work of this committee, participating members also gain from the opportunity to learn often overlooked soft skills, such as networking, professional writing, and presentation skills.</p>

<p>Educational Outreach is the foundation and driving mission behind the entire Outreach department. The members of SSS balance their passion for the highly technical side of our organization with the dedication to the responsibility to educate others and inspire the next great engineers of our generation. Primary Ed-Out events include our annual exhibit at Engineering Open House (EOH), a college-wide projects fair where we excitingly present to hundreds of students, children, parents, and community members. </p>

<p>Last year’s EOH exhibit included a video demonstration of a test engine of an I-class motor firing with both high-speed and thermal imaging. While some SSS members explained posters on SSS and high-power rocketry to visitors, others ran an interactive “Sharpie Rocket” activity where kids learned about the basics components of a rocket while making their very own miniature model rocket. This year’s exhibit will be modeling after last year’s highly successful debut, and will be additionally doing demonstrations with black powder ejection charges as well as the thermal properties of a real Space Shuttle tile. In addition to presenting at projects fairs, Ed-Out seeks to inspire on a more intimate scale by creating interactive learning experiences for local schools and youth groups.

<p>This past November, three SSS members traveled to Sadorus, IL to present to a local 4-H youth group. The students were challenged to identify the basic components of a rocket and their purposes. The kids were awed by a live demonstration of the thermal properties of a real tile from Space Shuttle Atlantis as they learned the importance of choosing proper materials. The day’s event culminated with a true engineering challenge in which they had to build an apparatus to transport ping-pong balls across containers using only household items like straws, clay, and paperclips. The supervising SSS members were impressed by the ingenuity, teamwork, and creativity of the 12-year-olds, especially of team “Scoopers,” which managed to transport a total of 24 ping-pong balls in just 90 seconds!

<p>Perhaps one of the more immediate influencing efforts of the Outreach department is recruitment of current students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Quad Day, an annual enormous presentation of Registered Student Organization (RSOs) at UIUC in late August is a cornerstone of our recruiting. This past year at our first ever Quad Day, we drew over 250 signatures from interested students across dozens of majors and departments. We converted this initial interest into an email retention rate of 50% and an active member list of over 50 undergraduate students. Additional university recruiting happens at E-Night and other university-wide and engineering-specific events. While these are all examples of large-scale recruiting, our focus on personal word-of-mouth spreading of interest is also paramount and highly effective. [SEE QUAD DAY PICTURE ALBUM]</p>
