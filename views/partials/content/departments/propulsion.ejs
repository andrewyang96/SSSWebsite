<p>The Department of Propulsion conducts research and development in the areas of propellants, pump control systems, ground testing, nozzles and ground testing. Our main goals are to create and analyze the performance of hybrid engines which will be used on all future rockets. The department also hopes to further the capabilities of our engines in areas including thrust vectoring and throttling.</p>
