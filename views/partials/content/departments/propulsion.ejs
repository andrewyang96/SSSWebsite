<p>The Department of Propulsion creates rocket propulsion technology for Student Space Systems. Its main goals are to create and analyze the performance of hybrid engines for usage on Phase rockets. Research and development is mainly dedicated towards propellants, fuel containment, pump control systems, fuel injection, nozzles, and ground testing. The department also hopes to further the capabilities of our engines in areas including thrust vectoring and throttling.</p>

<h3>G.O.R.E. Mk. I Hybrid Rocket Motor</h3>
<h4>Injection Manager: Justin Paul</h4>

<h4>Structure and Integration Manager: James Hall</h4>

<p>A hybrid rocket motor is a complex rocket engine that uses two phases of reactants, a solid fuel and a gaseous/liquid oxidizer, to produce powerful, efficient propulsion. The gaseous/liquid oxidizer is stored in a pressurized tank at the front of the engine. It is released through a pressure regulator into an injector which evenly distributes the flow of oxidizer. The injector exposes the oxidizer to the fuel-coated combustion chamber where the oxidizer interacts with the surface of the fuel to combust, produce expanding exhaust, and heat the rest of the fuel. The exhaust then travels to the end of the combustion chamber, where it is compressed and released through the nozzle.</p>

<p>Our hybrid rocket engine, named G.O.R.E. Mk. I, reacts gaseous N2O at 2000 psi in tank and 841 psi after regulator with rubberized HTPB fuel. N2O is a non-toxic gas which does not ignite spontaneously under normal conditions. It may intensify fires or cause asphyxiation, so to preserve safety, we use it in a controlled, well-ventilated environment at all times. HTPB is a mild skin irritant and non-spontaneously flammable, but with proper attention and safety equipment, it is not a significant hazard to health. We chose these propellants according to various criteria including, but not limited to, price, spontaneity, safety, and availability of documentation.</p>

<p>We used NASA-sponsored aerodynamics software Rocket Propulsion Analysis to predict the theoretical behavior of our engine. We predicted that we will reach a chamber pressure of 700-800 psi, chamber temperature of 3,350 K,  specific impulse (by mass) of 2269.8 N*s/kg, and thrust coefficient of 1.476. We accounted these values into our design, and promptly did calculations to determine that our setup was capable of containing and managing these temperatures and pressures.</p>

<p>G.O.R.E. Mk. I will be the most powerful hybrid motor produced by the University of Illinois with a total impulse output of 3372 lbf*s (15,000 N*s) and a maximum thrust output of 1237 lbf. We are aiming for a 3 to 4 second engine fire.</p>

<p>The first cold flow test of the hybrid motor was conducted on 06/20/2015. A cold flow test is when the oxidizer is flowed through the system to check for leaks as well as to ensure that the correct flow time is achieved and that the materials sustain the extremely high pressure. The test was conducted, and resulted in a success. Two small leaks were found and fixed, along with the materials sustaining the 800 psi and up pressures. A second flow test is currently in the works to ensure that the leaks were fixed and that our flow conditions are still satisfied.</p>

<h3>Second Generation Hybrid Propulsion Research</h3>
<h4>Project Manager: James Hall</h4>

<p>At the beginning of the 2015 summer session, the Department of Propulsion created a research team with the goal to begin researching fuel mixtures and rocket integration for future hybrid motors. Research has been plentiful in all areas and has allowed the department to become better equipped and knowledgeable for next yearâ€™s projects.</p>
