<p>The Department of Structures is in charge of the design and construction of the Main Phase rockets, in addition to the reflight preparation of previous rockets for research purposes. The Structures department is also in charge of propulsion and avionics integration for the Main Phase rocket, designing rocket structures around these systems. In addition to the construction of rockets, Structures is actively involved in research into the design of future rockets. These projects include the introduction of student-manufactured composite materials into rockets, conduction flow simulations on rockets, and designing advanced rocket architectures.</p>
