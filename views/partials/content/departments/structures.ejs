<p>The Department of Structures is in charge of the design and construction of the Phase rocket airframes,, in addition to the reflight preparation of previous rockets for research purposes. Structures is responsible for developing sturdy and lightweight rocket components that can withstand not only the intense stresses of supersonic flight, but also for the safe and effective integration of new technologies developed by Propulsion, Avionics, and Special Projects. In addition to the construction of rocket airframes, Structures is actively involved in research in areas such as student-manufactured composite rocket components, computational fluid dynamics simulations on rockets, fuel tanks, and advanced rocket architectures.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>2015-2016</h3>

<h3>Phase IV Engine Integration</h3>
<h4>Project Manager: Brandon Johnson</h4>

<p>The Phase IV rocket requires brand new architecture to accommodate our hybrid engine. Chief among these changes is the development of an oxidizer tank, meant to both hold pressurized oxidizer for the engine and to act as a section of the airframe. The project team is moving quickly so that we have plenty of time to test the oxidizer tank before the launch of Phase IV.</p>

<h3>Phase IV Parachutes</h3>
<h4>Project Manager: Meghana Veeramachaneni</h4>

<p>One of the most critical systems on a high-power rocket is the parachute system. At higher altitudes, the normal solutions for parachute deployment often fail, which inevitably ends with the destruction of the rocket. The Airframe team is working on developing a new, reliable parachute deployment system so that Student Space Systems can recover and reuse our research rockets. The team is currently working on a design for a prototype reefing system. This design will use a linear friction brake to slowly release the main parachute to eliminate excess drift.</p>

<h3>Phase IV Payload</h3>
<h4>Project Manager: Sam Wagner</h4>

<p>The ultimate purpose of our rockets is to launch scientific payloads into near-space and space conditions. To accommodate this goal, the Payload team is designing an payload bay and nosecone capable of carrying scientific instruments and avionics. Live radio telemetry is a SSS staple, and the Payload team is working to design our own radio-transparent composite nosecones in-house. Working in UIUC’s composite manufacturing lab, SSS members will lay up a fiberglass shroud for our nose cone. The nose cone will be tipped with steel to prevent melting as the rocket passes through Mach 3.</p>

<h3>Phase III - Olympus</h3>
<h4>Project Manager: Augusto de Oliveira</h4>

<p>The Phase III team is currently preparing our Phase III rocket for launch this semester. The Phase III rocket, otherwise known as Olympus, will achieve a max altitude above 30,000 ft and will need to be launching at a site near Edwards Air Force Base. This is Student Space Systems’ first primarily aluminum rocket and marks the organization’s transition from standard kit rockets to custom manufactured platforms. Olympus stands at 12 ft tall and measures just 4 inches in diameter. It will fly on an N1560 motor, which will accelerate the rocket at more 13G’s for 10 seconds. Reaching a top speed of 1200 mph at burnout, the Olympus will coast for nearly a minute to an altitude of 32,000ft and descend safely on a 14ft parachute.</p>

<h3>Launch Tower</h3>
<h4>Project Manager: Edgar Garcia</h4>

<p>The Launch Tower team is designing and building a platform capable of launching all of Student Space Systems’ future rockets. This tower will be modular and easy to move across the country to various launch sites. The launch tower team is also working on infrastructure to enable remote fueling of rockets, which SSS deems as a necessity for the safety of its members.</p>

<h3>Flight Simulation</h3>
<h4>Project Manager: Tyler Tetef</h4>

<p>Flight Simulation is currently researching the available Computational Fluid Dynamics software packages to find Student Space Systems a solution for the modeling of its rockets. This modeling is critical to the design process of high-power rockets, as we must ensure that our platforms are designed to handle all possible operating conditions they may encounter. We are currently using ANSYS Fluent and NX 9 to model the performance of past rockets in an attempt to verify the results of our simulations, and will later apply lessons learned to design of Phase IV. It is critical that we model the supersonic flows and shockwaves around the nose cone and fins, as the success of the rocket hinges on the durability of these systems.</p>


<h3>2014-2015</h3>

<h3>Phase III Airframe</h3>

<p>The Phase III rocket represents a monumental shift in the way SSS designs and constructs its phase rockets. Whereas all past rocket were constructed of fiberglass parts purchased from amatuer rocketry suppliers, Phase III will be constructed out of aluminum bought from non-rocketry suppliers. The aluminum construction of the rocket will allow for an increase in sophistication of custom student-built parts, such as a removable airframe-integrated camera mount and a heavy-duty motor retainer. In addition, a brazing technique will be demonstrated on Phase III in the form of a critical weld between the airframe and its high-performance aluminum fins.</p>

<h3>Custom Composite Parts</h3>

<p>The manufacturing of composite rocket components is critical to the Department of Structures’ goal of producing tough and lightweight launch vehicles. Students involved in the project researched the various composite layup techniques before fabricating their own composite fins in the UIUC Composites Lab. SSS students will continue to refine their techniques in order to create parts such as heat-resistant fins, bulkheads, and nose cone shrouds.</p>
