<p>Because going to space can be such a dangerous mission, the Department of Safety maintains safety as a top priority for SSS. To make sure that all of its launches, tests, lab sessions, meetings, and members are always safe, Safety requires that all members receive training for the proper use of tools and lab space as well as launch and testing safety. SSS also coordinates with rocketry clubs and the FAA so all launches and tests adhere to the strictest safety standards set by the governing organizations and bodies of rocketry. The Safety Officer is in charge of ensuring safety for Student Space Systems.</p>
