<p>The Department of Special Projects is the odd one out when it comes to the Departments of Student Space Systems. In it’s purest form, Special Projects is the umbrella department for everything that is too much a triangular peg to fit into a single square-holed department. Because of this encompassing nature, Special Projects is split into three groups: Research and Development, a team of students dedicated to experimenting in the furthest reaches of SSS’s technical reach, Level One Certification, an organized group which allows students to fulfill the requirements for getting a NAR Level One High Powered Rocketry certificate, and Space Grant, SSS’s entry into the NASA Space Grant Competition. Currently, the Research and Development team is working to finish construction of our own Reactive Control System, a system which will allow us to control a rocket during its ascent by means of compressed CO2. Construction is almost complete, and soon we will begin programming and testing. We hope to have a working prototype by the end of the semester. In Level One Certification, students will soon begin building their rockets, in hopes to launch them as soon as the weather turns for the better. In Space Grant, we have finalized the design, and are poised to begin construction and testing for the competition later this semester. All in all, Special Projects is ready for an exciting semester!</p>
