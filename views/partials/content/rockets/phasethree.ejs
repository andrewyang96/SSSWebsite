<p>Phase III is SSSâ€™s main project for the 2014-2015 academic year, with the goal of sending a student-designed rocket to 50,000ft. Far more powerful than anything launched by SSS to date, the Phase III rocket will push the boundaries of amateur rocketry, requiring a new structural design, a CO2 ejection system, and an advanced avionics system to be developed. In order to fly this rocket, we must go farther than ever before, all the way to the deserts of Nevada. Scheduled to launch in September of 2015, work on the Phase III rocket will continue through the Spring 2015 semester.</p>
