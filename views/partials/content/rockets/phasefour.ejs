<p>Our Phase IV rocket is the primary rocket design project for the 2015-2016 school year. Most likely launching in the Fall of 2016, Phase IV will aim to reach 100,000 feet and fly on our G.O.R.E. Mk II hybrid rocket engine. The rocket is currently being designed and has recently just passed its Preliminary Design Review (PDR). Initial designs show the rocket to be approximately 20 feet tall and 8 inches in diameter. Phase IV will be designed to capture multiple camera angles, transmit live telemetry, and fly experimental payloads. Phase IV will maximize the safety of its payload with the integration of an Engine Control Unit, built on ARM and FPGA technologies, which will actively monitor and control the G.O.R.E. engine to prevent critical failures.</p>

<p>Phase IV is a major step for SSS as it is our first rocket that will be able to fly functioning payloads. Built with the capability to accommodate various payload configurations, Phase IV will allow us to provide any other University affiliated organization with the ability to conduct experiments at high altitudes.</p>
