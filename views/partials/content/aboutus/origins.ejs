<p>Student Space Systems began in a freshman level computer aided design class. Inspired by Derek Deville’s “Qu8k” rocket, Benjamin Wexler came up with the idea of getting a group of students together to build and design a rocket that would go to 100,000 ft by the time they graduated. Benjamin then pitched the idea to his friend and classmate Chris Smith. Together they came up with a framework of the club. They then got some additional friends together and decided that they shouldn't just stop at 100,000 ft, but that they should aim to create a club that could have a true impact. To this end, they decided that the club’s mission would be to reach suborbital space and do so reliably enough to fly research payloads for decades beyond.</p>
