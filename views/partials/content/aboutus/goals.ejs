<p>At Student Space Systems we pride ourselves on being a technical organization. We have a wide range of projects, all of which are stepping stones to our overall goal of reaching suborbital space by 2024. Every year has a regimented altitude goal leading us toward the 100km official space benchmark, and accompanying projects within the departments of Propulsion, Avionics, Special Projects, and Structures will contribute invaluable technologies necessary to each coming launch.</p>

<p>In addition to our primary goal of eventually achieving spaceflight, we are dedicated to educating others about high-powered rocketry. Students involved in SSS are given a truly hands-on learning experience and opportunities to be certified through the National Association of Rocketry (NAR) and Tripoli. We also seek to emulate a corporate community by keeping a professional environment, and focus on preparing our members for their future careers by exposing them to these workplace standards early on.</p>
