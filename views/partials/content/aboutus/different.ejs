<p>What sets up apart from other student organizations is that our main goal is to give new members the ability to work on meaningful hands-on projects as soon as possible. In some cases, new members to organizations will be separated from the main workforce for months until they learn or are taught the necessary skills to actually be capable of helping the organization with their projects. With Student Space Systems, we believe that the skills you need to be able to contribute you can learn while actually contributing as experience is the best teacher.  Additionally, though each department has many small tech projects across many disciplines, they all come together to form the rockets that take us closer to space.  This allows our members to work on subjects that interest them while still contributing to our mission.</p>
