<p>What sets us apart from other student organizations is that one of our main goals is to give new members the ability to work on meaningful hands-on projects as soon as possible. In some cases, new members to organizations will be separated from the main workforce for months until they learn or are taught the necessary skills to actually be capable of helping the organization with its projects. At Student Space Systems, we believe that the best way to learn new technical skills is to be able to get hands on experience from the beginning of the learning process. Even though each department has many small tech projects spanning multiple disciplines, they all come together to build the rockets that take us closer to space. This allows our members to work on subjects that interest them while still contributing to our mission.</p>
