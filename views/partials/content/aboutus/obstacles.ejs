<p>As an undergraduate organization, we of course have a unique set of challenges.  Since most students are only at the university four years, we have to quickly train and prepare new members to be able to complete work that is a challenge even for professionals.  Few of our members have much experience with working in industry, so we have to help them to work effectively in a fast-paced, professional environment while getting them the training they need to complete highly technical work.  To this end we are always searching for mentors in the aerospace, mechanical, and electric industries.</p>
